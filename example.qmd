## Hello, There

This presentation shows a few slides made by Quarto and [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com) along with header logo and header text which are easily embedded by using the Quarto filter `reveal-header`


## Slide Backgrounds {background="#43464B"}

This slide is created using the `background` attribute (`background="#43464B"}`) and as you can see that header text color is different (difference is trivial though) than before.

if you want you can change the color of the header text for slides with `background` attribute using css class `.inverse-header`. For example,

~~~
.inverse-header {
  color: #c1c1c1 !important;
}
~~~

Here using `!important` is important :p.
